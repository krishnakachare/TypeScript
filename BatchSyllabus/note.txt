- ts + HTML
- Datatypes:
 1. Primitive(immutable): string, number, boolean, undefined, null, never, unknown, void
 2. Special datatype: any, literal, union(|), intersection(&) ,type
 3. Non-Primitive(mutable, user defined): array, object, class, function, tuple -> ?, enum, interface

 - Inferance vs annotation
 - -w
 - type assertion

/* 
enum: enumerated list or unchanged variables list

syntax: enum enumName { const1, const2, ...., constn}

can retrive: enumName.variableName

Note: variables holds const value, cant update it

*/

/* 

any, undefined, null, never, unknown, void

undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. It represents the absence of a value.

null: A value that explicitly represents the absence of a value.

never: A type that represents a value that never occurs. It is used for functions that never return.

unknown: A type that represents any value. It is the most general type in TypeScript.

void: A type that represents the absence of a return value. It is used for functions that do not return anything.

*/

// TS advantage: type restriction.
// use any type:
// any not recommended in ts because it removes all the advantages of typescript

// Union Type
// can combine multiple data types using | .
// | pipe, or operator

// union (|) --> OR type

// intersection (&): combine types


// NOTE:
/* 
- Any holding any type and can able to do any operations with it.
- Unknow can hold any type. But any time of operations need to check type check then only can able to do operations with unknown
*/

// type alias or custome type

/* 
 type typeName = type
*/



// literal Type


/* 
interface:

  what is interface ?
      An interface is a TypeScript structure used to define the shape of an object.
      object means --> object, class, function


syntax: 

    interface interfaceName {
        keyName: type
    }
*/

/* 
type vs interface :

# type:
  - type literal no for class, only type annotate in class defination
  - used for specific primitive datatype
  - Can able to do Intersection(&), Union(|)

==========================================

# interface:
  - defining structure for object, function, class
  - used for specific non-primitive datatype
  - can able to do extends, merging, add modifiers & indexing
