Here’s the **clear difference between `!` and `?` in TypeScript** 👇

---

## ✅ `!` (Definite Assignment Assertion)

```ts
name!: string;
```

✔ Means: *"This property will definitely get a value later."*
✔ Used to silence constructor initialization errors
❌ Does NOT make the property optional
❌ No runtime behavior

Example:

```ts
class User {
  name!: string;
}
```

---

## ✅ `?` (Optional Property)

```ts
name?: string;
```

✔ Means: *"This property may or may not exist."*
✔ Type becomes `string | undefined`
✔ Safe to skip during object creation

Example:

```ts
class User {
  name?: string;
}
```

## 🔥 Side-by-side Comparison

| Feature                      | `!`                    | `?`    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| Property required?           | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ No   |
| Can be `undefined`?          | ❌ (as per type system) | ✅      |
| Used for constructor errors? | ✅                      | ❌      |
| Runtime effect?              | ❌ None                 | ❌ None |

---

## 🧠 Rule of thumb:

* Use `!` when **you promise** it will be assigned later
* Use `?` when **it’s optional**
