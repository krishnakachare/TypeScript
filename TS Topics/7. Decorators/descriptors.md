In your TypeScript code, you're using a **method decorator** called `LogMethod`. The `descriptor` in this context is an object known as a **property descriptor**, specifically a `PropertyDescriptor`, which describes the characteristics of the method being decorated.

### üîç **What is `descriptor` (PropertyDescriptor)?**

The `descriptor` is the **third parameter** of a method decorator. It provides detailed metadata about the method it decorates.

#### It contains properties such as:

- **`value`**: The actual method/function.
- **`writable`**: Whether the method can be reassigned.
- **`enumerable`**: Whether the method shows up during enumeration (like in `for...in` loops).
- **`configurable`**: Whether the method descriptor can be changed or deleted.

---

### üí° In your example:

```ts
function LogMethod(
  target: any,
  propertyName: string,
  descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value; // Original method: add()
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${propertyName} with`, args);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args); // Call the original method
  };
}
```

- `descriptor.value` is the original `add` method.
- You are **replacing** it with a new function that:

  1. Logs the method call and its arguments.
  2. Executes the original method using `apply()`.

This allows you to **inject behavior** (like logging) around the method call without changing the method itself.

---

### üß† Summary

- `descriptor` = metadata about the method.
- You use it to **intercept, modify, or enhance** method behavior.
- It's essential in **creating decorators** that extend or log functionality.
