## 1. Introduction to TypeScript

### What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a **typed superset of JavaScript** developed by Microsoft. It adds **static typing**, **interfaces**, **type annotations**, and **advanced object-oriented features** to JavaScript. TypeScript code compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any JavaScript environment (browsers, Node.js, etc.).

### History and Evolution
- Developed by Microsoft and released in **2012**.
- Initially created to overcome limitations in JavaScript for building large-scale applications.
- Gained popularity with the rise of SPAs (Single Page Applications) and frameworks like Angular.
- Now actively used in both frontend and backend ecosystems.

### Why Use TypeScript?

#### Benefits Over JavaScript:
- **Type Safety**: Detect errors at compile-time.
- **Better Tooling**: Autocompletion, IntelliSense.
- **Code Maintainability**: Strong typing and modularity.
- **Self-Documentation**: Types explain the code.

#### Type Safety & Static Typing:
- Types are checked at compile time, helping avoid runtime bugs.

#### Readability & Maintainability:
- Clear types improve readability and make refactoring safer.

#### Improved Developer Experience:
- Autocomplete, navigation, and reduced errors during development.

### JavaScript vs TypeScript

| Feature | JavaScript | TypeScript |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Typing | Dynamic | Static |
| Compilation | Interpreted | Compiled |
| Tooling | Basic | Advanced |
| Features | ES Standard | Adds Classes, Interfaces, Enums |

**Pros:** Type safety, scalability  
**Cons:** Requires compilation, learning curve

### Course Prerequisites
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js and npm
- IDE (VS Code recommended)
