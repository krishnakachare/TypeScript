Typescript: Typescript is open source programming language that adds static typing to JS.
How it will add it? Typescript will have a transpiler which transpiles code from ts to js because browser only understand js.
Transpiler vs compiler: Transpiler convert code form one programming language into another programming language. compiler will convert high level programming into low level programming.

package.json is used for metadata of the project like project name,project details,dependencies,scripts.

package-lock.json: it is a meta data about package.json. it contains in detail about all the packages installed in the project.

Node modules: node modules is a folder where your dependencies will be installed.

"tsc - init "  will produce tsconfig file.
tsc means typescript compiler. tsconfig file contains set of rules that typescript compiler follows when it is converting ts into js.

Typescript will check data types in two ways
1. type annotation: we have to explicitly mention the data type
2.type inference: based on initial value ts only guess the type
