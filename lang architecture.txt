# The architecture of Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript is written using different languages:
    1. Python's Architecture:
        Written in: Primarily C (also known as CPython, the most common Python implementation).
        Alternative Implementations:
        PyPy: Written in RPython (a restricted subset of Python).
        Jython: Written in Java (runs Python on the JVM).
        IronPython: Written in C# (runs Python on the .NET framework).

    2. JavaScript's Architecture:
        Written in: Primarily C++
        Popular JavaScript Engines:
        V8 (Chrome, Node.js) → Written in C++
        SpiderMonkey (Firefox) → Written in C++
        JavaScriptCore (Safari) → Written in C++
        Chakra (Edge, older versions) → Written in C++

    3. TypeScript's Architecture:
        Written in: TypeScript & JavaScript
        Compiled to: JavaScript
        TypeScript is just a superset of JavaScript, so its compiler (tsc) is written in TypeScript itself and then compiled to JavaScript.
